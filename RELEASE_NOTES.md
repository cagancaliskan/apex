# Release v1.0.6 - Slower Live Simulation

**Release Date:** January 1, 2026

This release slows down the live race simulation for better usability.

## 🐌 Simulation Updates
- **Slower Pace**: Increased the time between simulated laps to **3.0 seconds** (previously 0.5s - 1.0s). This makes the data stream much easier to follow and analyze in real-time.
- **Backend Defaults**: Updated server defaults to match the new slower pace.
